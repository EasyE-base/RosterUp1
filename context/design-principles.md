# RosterUp Design Principles

## Core Philosophy
Inspired by Apple's design philosophy, RosterUp embraces simplicity, elegance, and clarity. Every design decision should enhance the user experience through thoughtful minimalism.

## 1. Simplicity First
- **Remove Complexity**: Strip away unnecessary elements, keeping only what serves a clear purpose
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Use size, weight, and spacing to guide the eye naturally
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Users should never wonder where to click next

## 2. Generous White Space
- **Breathing Room**: Give elements space to be appreciated
- **Focus Through Isolation**: Important elements stand alone
- **Clean Margins**: Consistent spacing creates rhythm and flow

## 3. Typography Excellence
- **System Fonts**: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Inter' for perfect rendering
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Limited font sizes with clear purpose
- **Readable Always**: Minimum 16px body text, high contrast ratios

## 4. Color Restraint
- **Monochromatic Base**: Black, white, and grays form the foundation
- **Purposeful Accent**: Blue (#0071E3) for primary actions only
- **Athletic Energy**: Subtle orange (#FF6B35) for sport-specific elements

## 5. Motion & Interaction
- **Subtle Animations**: 0.3s ease transitions as standard
- **Responsive Feedback**: Every interaction acknowledged
- **Natural Physics**: Elements move as users expect

## 6. Performance & Quality
- **Lightning Fast**: <2s page loads, instant interactions
- **Pixel Perfect**: Every detail matters at every screen size
- **Accessible Always**: WCAG AA compliance minimum

## 7. Content First
- **Clear Messaging**: Every word has purpose
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Most important information is unmissable
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show complexity only when needed

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Start with mobile design, scale up
2. Test on real devices regularly
3. Prefer native patterns over custom solutions
4. Question every element - if unsure, remove it
5. Consistency trumps creativity
