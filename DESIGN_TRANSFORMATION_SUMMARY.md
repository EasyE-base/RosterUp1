## Design Principles Applied:
- ✅ Simplicity first - removed unnecessary elements
- ✅ Generous white space - increased padding and margins
- ✅ Typography excellence - clean hierarchy with system fonts
- ✅ Color restraint - minimal palette with purposeful accents
- ✅ Subtle animations - 0.3s transitions throughout
- ✅ Content first - clear messaging and visual hierarchy

## Next Steps:
1. Deploy changes to see the new design live
2. Update remaining pages (browse/listings) with Apple aesthetic
3. Add subtle animations and micro-interactions
4. Optimize images and performance
5. Conduct accessibility audit
